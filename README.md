# CivicInfoEmailer

This iOS Application connects users to their Representatives in the U.S. Government. Leverage Googleâ€™s Civic Info Api to retreive data on those who represent you both locally and nationally. Compose and send and email or contact your representatives via phone.

### Architecture

CivicInfoEmailer demonstrates the Model-View-Presenter architecture pattern.

###### View

```Swift
class MainViewController: UIViewController
{
    fileprivate var mainPresenter = MainPresenter()
    
    override func viewDidLoad()
    {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        mainPresenter.attachView(view: self)
        mainPresenter.getInitialRepresentatives()
    }
}
```

###### Presenter

```Swift
class MainPresenter {
    
    private var representativeView : RepresentativeView?
    
    func attachView(view: RepresentativeView) {
        representativeView = view
    }
    
    func detachView() {
        representativeView = nil
    }
    
    func getInitialRepresentatives()
    {
        ClientService.requestRepresentatives()
    }
}
```

### Image Caching

Each prototype cell in the MainTableView contains an image caching mechanism. As the tableView dequeues each cell, the imageCache will persist downloaded images. When a cell is reloaded by the tableView, those images are immediately available without another asynchronous download.

````Swift
class MainTableViewCell: UITableViewCell {
    
    let imageCache = NSCache<NSString, UIImage>()
    
    public var representative : Representative?
  
        didSet
        {    
            if (representative?.imageURL != nil)
            {
                /*The key to each image in imageCache 
                is created from the url path to the image*/   
                let key: NSString = NSString(string: url.path)

                //Check for image in cache            
                if (imageCache.object(forKey: key) != nil)
                {
                    photoView.image = imageCache.object(forKey: key)

                    self.hideStatusIndicator()

                } else {
                    //A key was not found for this image
                    //Load the image asynchronously
                }
````
### Tests

###### Mocks

The SampleJSON.txt file contains data to mock a CivicInfo Api response. This data may be modified in order to test deserialization methods. 

Load mock JSON data by switching this bool value in MainPresenter.swift.

```Swift
class MainPresenter {
    
    //TESTING?
    private var inTestMode: Bool = true
```

Setting this 'true' prompts the presenter's address property to load from the local JSON file.

```Swift
private var address: Address? {
        didSet {
            
            if self.inTestMode {
                //TEST
                ClientService.testRequest(completion: {
                    
                    (representatives: [Representative]?) in
                    
                    if (representatives != nil) {
                        self.mainView?.update(representatives: representatives!)
                    }
                })
            }
```

To mock location data (i.e. CLPlacemark) simply call the mockPlacemark function. 

```Swift 
extension AddressTest {
    func mockPlacemark() -> CLPlacemark {
        return MKPlacemark(coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 37, longitude: 93))
    }
}
```

### Motivation

This application is meant to remove barriers between U.S. Representatives and their constituents. Scroll through the Representatives who make legislation that directly affects your life. If Google's Civic Info Api provides an email address for the Representative, you may easily compose and send an email.
